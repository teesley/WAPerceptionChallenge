I did not come in with OpenCV experience so the learning curve was initially pretty steep. Although I still have yet to achieve perfect results for both lines, I am continung to tweak things to try to better understand how to get the best results possible. The line nearly perfectly goes through the left row of cones, however with the right row of cones, not so much.
